# Ride Sharing Investment Analysis
Module14 Challenge
## Overview of Analysis
We are working to bring a bike share program to Des Moines. Our investors want to see bike share data, so we are using New York CitiShare bike data to create charts and graphs for them in Tableau. These charts and graphs will be used for a business proposal to bring the bikes to Des Moines.

## Bike Usage by Gender

The first pie graph shows bike users by gender; it shows most bike users (65%) are male. Then we looked at how trip duration by gender. The chart for men is heavily skewed right, with the most bikes being rode for about 5 minutes and almost completely tapering off (less than 1,000 users) after an hour. Women follow a similar pattern, but with less users. For unknown gender users, they have less of a spike in use and tend to follow a more steady plateau in use time, but still hardly any use the bikes for more than an hour.

This chart shows the saturation nof users by time of day/day of the week separated by gender using a heatmap. Men and women follow a similar pattern, although there are in general more male users. On weekdays, the bikes are used the most during regular commuting hours (8-9am, 5-6pm) except for wednesday evening where there is a noticeable decrease, likely due to a specific regional factor. On the weekends, the bikes are used the most during the late afternoon (10 am) to early evening (5pm). The unknown population uses the bikes the most on saturdays and sundays in the middle of the day, but there are far fewer unknown users in general.

This chart uses a heat map to look at the day of the week used most often by gender, separated between customers and subscribers. In general, there are more subscriber users in both the male and female categories. The heatmap pattern for men and women mirror one another, but with far fewer female users. Users ride the bikes the most on Thursdays. Unknown users are more often general customers and not subscribers. They use the bikes the most on Saturdays.

## Overall Trip Duration

This graph shows the duration of time on the bikes by number of users. Most users ride the bikes for about five minutes, with a gradual decrease until an hour where almost no users (less than 1,000) use the bikes. 

## Overall Use by Time of Day
![data3.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurenDebes/BikeSharing/main/data3.png)
This chart shows the saturation of users by time of day and day of the week using a heatmap. On weekdays, the bikes are used the most during regular commuting hours (8-9am, 5-6pm) except for wednesday evening where there is a noticeable decrease, likely due to a specific regional factor. On the weekends, the bikes are used the most during the late afternoon (10 am) to early evening (5pm). 

![data6.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurenDebes/BikeSharing/main/data6.png)
This chart uses a bar chart to show the number of users in August by time of day. There are the most users at 5:00pm followed by 6:00pm and 8:00 am. The fewest number of riders are between 3-4 am.

# Overall Summary
In general, we can see that mostly men use the bike service and use it to commute to work or during the day on the weekends. It is safe to assume these bikes are being used to get to work on the weekdays, and for leisure on the weekends. If the bikes could be placed in areas close to large office spaces or closer to residential areas, this would help the work commuters. Bikes placed in popular weekend destinations such as farmers markets, bar/restaurant districts, museums/event venues, and parks would be more likely to be used.

These are two other graphs/charts that could be made for investors:
- Top starting and ending locations by day of the week, using a map chart colored by day of the week for the dots and able to be filtered by day of the week.
- User types by age, using bar charts separated by user type. This could be used to tailor marketing towards populations that do not use them often, such as offering senior or student discounts for subscriptions.
